 ## Description

    Welcome to my Employee tracker! This application was created with Node.js using the built in 
    package Inquirer (for collecting user input). This application also uses mySQL and mySQL2 package
    and is using console.table package to show tables in the command line! This
    application is ran from the back-end and does not have a deployed page however, 
    it can be ran on the command line!
